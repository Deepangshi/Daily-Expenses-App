# Expense Tracker App
## Project Overview

This project is an Expense Tracker App designed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. It allows users to record their daily expenses and income, categorize transactions, and view summaries of their spending patterns over time.

This project has two main modules: Categories and Transactions, enriched with features like form controls, chart elements, navigational controls, and more.

### Modules and Features

- **Transactions Module**: The Transaction controller handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tracking daily expenses. Users can input, view, modify, and delete expense records seamlessly.
- **Categories Module**: The Categories controller manages the different categories of expenses, such as groceries, utilities, and entertainment. This enables better organization and classification of transactions, facilitating users in keeping their finances well-organized.

### Dashboard

A key feature of the Dashboard is the chart visualization, which displays records of the past 30 days. This interactive chart helps users to visually track their spending and income over the last month, offering insights into their financial habits and helping identify areas for potential savings.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET MVC**: A framework for building web apps and APIs with the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- **Entity Framework**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET, simplifying data access by abstracting the database layer.
- **SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, designed to handle a wide range of data processing requirements in enterprise environments.

Key features include:
- Expense and income tracking
- Categorization and Transactions
- Visual reports for better insight into spending habits with charts in Dashboard
- User-friendly interface for ease of use
